# Node.js module.exports vs. exports

Always, in CommonJS, we use `module.exports` or `exports` to export functions, variables, etc. 
However, it's generally recommended to use `module.exports` for consistency and to avoid potential issues.

Here's why:

- **Returned Value**: When you use require to import a module in another file, only the value assigned to `module.exports` is actually returned. exports itself is not returned.
- **Reference**: `exports` is simply a reference to `module.exports`. Initially, they both point to the same empty object.

Based on the two rules above, if you export like this way:

```js copy filename="lib.js"
exports = {
  add: (a, b) => a + b,
  MAX: 20,
};
```

and use like this:


```js copy filename="index.js"
const lib = require("./lib");

console.log(lib); // {}
console.log(lib.add(1, 2)); // TypeError: lib.add is not a function
console.log(lib.MAX); // undefined
```

it will be throw errors.

In javascript, we know if we change the attributes of an object, 
that will be affect all the values referenced to this object:

```js {3} copy
const a = { v: 1 };
const b = a;
b.v = 2;
console.log(a); // { v: 2 }
```

but if we re-assign the whole reference object to other value, 
then any changes to the object will not make any effects to the original one:

```js {3, 6} copy
const a = { v: 1 };
let b = a;
b.v = 2;
console.log(a); // { v: 2 }

b = { v: 3 };
console.log(a); // { v: 2 }
```

since the module just return `module.exports` when it required, 
assigning a new object to `exports` can break the reference between `exports` and `module.exports`.

So, that's the why we should always use `module.exports` instead of `exports` in CJS modules.

While it's technically possible to use `exports` for individual property assignments, 
it's generally discouraged due to the potential for confusion and the risk of accidentally breaking the reference.

Here's an alternative way to use `exports` (but consider `module.exports` for better practice):

```js copy
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
exports.MAX = (a, b) => 20;
```

or

```js copy
exports = {
  add: (a, b) => a + b,
  MAX: 20,
};

module.exports = exports;
```

The reason is obvious.

However, to maintain consistency and avoid confusion, 
it's strongly recommended to use `module.exports` throughout your code.
